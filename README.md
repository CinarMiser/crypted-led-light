# crypted-led-light
its an arduino project with 2 buttons and 2 led lights. One of the led light is always on and other is not every time you press a button the button which is always on closes and if you press the buttons at the right amount the led light which is closed becomes on for a while. Its a project to learn how buttons are working in arduino


In my circuit i connected the closed led light to the 13th digital input on arduino uno and i connected the always on led light to the 12th input on arduino uno.
For buttons i connected the first button to the 8th input and second button to the 7th input on ardunio uno.
